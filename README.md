1. Abstract: provide a summary describing the problem you chose, how you tackled it, and a summary of your results.
2. Introduction: describe your problem in detail and summarize your approach and findings
3. Dataset: describe the dataset you used to train your models, and any pre-processing steps you performed.
4. Models: describe the models you used to tackle your problem, and how you trained, tuned and validated them. Please be specific and concise. Also, provide the rationale behind your choices.
5. Results: describe the experiments you ran to train and evaluate your models. Also, provide all results of your experiments and discuss them.
6. Conclusion: provide a concise conclusion of your project, highlighting the main results you achieved, and what future work could be.
7. References: a list of references that you used throughout your project.

## Code:
- Submit a notebook that includes all the code you used to tackle your problem including:
    - Data cleaning and data processing
    - Training 
    - Diagnosis
    - Hyper-parameter tuning
    - Model selection
- The notebook should be clear, well-structured, and well commented
- Submit the notebook through Moodle
- Required to maintain a Github repository with a properly documented code
- Include the link of that repository in the report
- The Github repository should have your final trained model available for download

## Model Testing:
- Trained model will be downloaded from the Github repository and will be tested on a holdout test
- Should submit a separate notebook for your project that can be used to upload your trained model and test it
- This notebook should perform all pre-processing steps needed to apply the model on raw test data
