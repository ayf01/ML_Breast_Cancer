# Paper 1  "Machine learning integrated ensemble of feature selection methods followed by survival analysis for predicting breast cancer subtype specific miRNA biomarkers" 
    - Features Selected:
        The paper employed an ensemble of feature selection methods to identify the most influential miRNA biomarkers for different breast cancer subtypes. The selected miRNAs are highly associated with the multiple breast cancer subtypes. Eight different feature selection methods were utilized: Mutual Information Maximization (MIM), Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR), Conditional Mutual Information Maximization (CMIM), Joint Mutual Information (JMI), Double Input Symmetrical Relevance (DISR), Interaction Capping (ICAP), Conditional Infomax Feature Extraction (CIFE), and Conditional Redundancy Reduction (CONDRED). Each method selected top-ranked miRNAs based on their classification accuracy, and the top features from each method were further combined to refine the selection​​.
    - Model Used:
        The selected features were then analyzed through a machine learning model that includes a survival analysis component. Initially, multiple machine learning techniques (SVM, ANN, KNN, DT, RF, NB, and DISCR) were evaluated based on their classification accuracy using the entire set of miRNA features. Based on their performance, the most effective technique was chosen for further analysis. The survival analysis component utilized Cox regression to evaluate the impact of the selected miRNA biomarkers on the survival of breast cancer patients, thus providing a clinically relevant measure of their importance​​.
        The integration of these diverse feature selection methods and the subsequent survival analysis underscores the comprehensive approach taken to pinpoint the most relevant biomarkers for breast cancer subtypes, which could significantly aid in improving prognosis and personalizing treatment strategies.
    - Best Performing Model:
        The best-performing model, as identified through the initial evaluation of multiple machine learning techniques, was the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The SVM was chosen due to its superior classification accuracy when using the selected miRNA features from the ensemble of feature selection methods​​.

# Paper 2 "Machine learning assisted analysis of breast cancer gene expression profiles reveals novel potential prognostic biomarkers for triple-negative breast cancer"
    - Features Selected:
        The study utilized a combination of Pearson’s correlation coefficient and Recursive Feature Elimination with Random Forest (RFE-RF) for feature selection. Initially, features with a Pearson correlation coefficient higher than 0.85 were eliminated to reduce redundancy. The RFE-RF algorithm was then employed to select the most relevant features from the dataset, which includes 20,756 gene products. The feature selection process identified the top 20 to 50 most relevant gene features from the datasets for model training​​.
    - Model Used:
        The selected features were used to train several machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. These models were trained to classify samples into Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) versus non-TNBC subtypes​​.
    - Best-Performing Model
        Among the models tested, XGBoost consistently showed superior performance across different sets of selected features, achieving the highest classification accuracy. This model proved particularly effective in handling the complex, high-dimensional genomic data typical in cancer research, outperforming other models like SVM, kNN, and Random Forest in this specific application​​.

# Paper 3 "Prediction of Breast Cancer, Comparative Review of Machine Learning Techniques, and Their Analysis"
    - Features Selected:
        The feature selection involved two main approaches. Initially, features were reduced by eliminating highly correlated genes (Pearson correlation coefficient higher than 0.85). Subsequently, Recursive Feature Elimination with Random Forest (RFE-RF) was employed to select the most predictive features. This method was applied iteratively to retrieve top features, refining the feature set to include the most relevant gene features for model training​​.
    - Model Used:
        The models tested included Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost. These models were used to classify samples into Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) versus non-TNBC subtypes based on the selected features​​.
    - Best-Performing Model:
        XGBoost emerged as the best-performing model, consistently achieving the highest classification accuracy across the tested feature sets. This model was particularly effective due to its ability to handle the complex and high-dimensional data derived from the multiplatform genomic data​​.
    
# Paper 4 "Multi-Modal Classification for Human Breast Cancer Prognosis Prediction: Proposal of Deep-Learning Based Stacked Ensemble Model"
    - Features Selected:
        The feature selection process employed the mRMR (Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance) algorithm for dimensionality reduction on a high-dimensional dataset, which included gene expression profiles, CNA (copy number alteration) profiles, and clinical data. The mRMR algorithm was used to incrementally select the best set of features from 100 up to 500 features in steps of 100, by evaluating the AUC values at each step. Ultimately, the top 400 gene expression features, 200 CNA features, and 25 clinical features were selected for the model​​.
    - Model Used:
        The proposed model is a stacked-based ensemble model incorporating CNNs for feature extraction and Random Forest (RF) for classification. Specifically, three independent CNNs were designed for each modality—clinical data, gene expression, and CNA. The CNNs were trained separately for each dataset, extracting hidden layer features which were then passed through an RF classifier for the final prediction​​.
    - Best-Performing Model:
        The stacked-based ensemble model using Random Forest with hidden features extracted from CNNs demonstrated the best performance. It outperformed all other methods in terms of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and Matthew's correlation coefficient across various tests. The model achieved an AUC value of 0.930, marking it as significantly superior in predicting breast cancer prognosis compared to other models like MDNNMD, SVM, and logistic regression​​.
